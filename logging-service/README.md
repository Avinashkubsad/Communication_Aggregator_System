** OVERVIEW OF THE LOGGING SERVICE **

  1. The Logging Service is responsible for collecting all logs generated by:
        --> Task Router Service
        --> Delivery Service
  2. It provides:
        --> Real-time log ingestion using Kafka
        --> Trace + sub-trace ingestion (traceId, spanId, parentSpanId)
  3. In-memory log storage for querying through GraphQL
  4. Output logs saved inside elasticsearch-data/service-logs.jsonl
      (for future Kibana/Elasticsearch integration)

--> PORT
  The service runs on port 5003

--> Topic 
    logs-topic (Consuming)
   All logs from Task Router and Delivery Service are pushed here.
   The Logging Service listens continuously and stores each event.  

--> Packages used 
  1. express --> Server wrapper for Apollo GraphQL
  2. apollo-server-express --> GraphQL API server
  3. kafkajs --> Kafka producer client
  4. uuid --> Generate traceId, spanId, messageId
  5. dotenv	--> Load environment variables
